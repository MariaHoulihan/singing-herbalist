## Bugs:

Initially when I ran the html code for all 3 of the website pages there were errors and warnings. There was an error on the script for the font awesome kit. I had placed the script tag for the kit outide of the body closing tag. Moving the font awesome script tag to inside the closing body tag fixed that. 

Also I had some opening tags but forgot the closing tags. All of these were easily fixed by going to the relevant lines of code and deleting or inserting closing tags.

I was a bit confused about id and class. In a few places I put id instead of class. The Nu Html Checker highlighted this and I able to rename id for class identifiers in the html and also make changes in the CSS as were necessary. This has really helped my learning and I feel more confident in using id and class as a result.

I had a space in one of the navigation links that I was not aware of until I checked the html code. The Nu html checker warned me of this and I deleted the space, and then it functioned appropriately.

## Validator Testing:

### HTML
No errors or warnings were noted when passing through the official W3C validator.

### CSS
No errors were noted when passing through the Jigsaw, CSS offical validator.

### Accessibility
I confirm that colors and fonts are easy to read and also that the accessiblity is high as can be seen in the below screenshot taken about it was ran through lighthouse in dev tools.
